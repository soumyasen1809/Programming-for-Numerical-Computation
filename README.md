Programming for Numerical Computation using C-OpenMP (Parallel Programming)

This course introduces students to MATLAB programming, and demonstrate itâ€™s use for scientific computations. The basis of computational techniques are expounded through various coding examples and problems. Although the course uses MATLAB as the programming language, with this project, I have tried to solve the exercises using C language. An attempt to parallelize the C code using OpenMP has been made.
